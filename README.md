# Word-Guess-Cli




## Description
This assignment was to create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.  I choose to use elements from the periodic table of elements as the words for this game. Since this game is run in node, it cannot be played in the browser.  A video will be attached showing the game being played so show its functionality. 


## Languages Used
Node, Javascript


## How to Play

1.  The game must be played in a node terminal.
2.  When the game starts, underscores will indicate how many letters are in the word.
3.  Select a letter, if it appears in the word, it was a correct guess.
4.  You will get to choose up to 12 letters to determine the word.
5.  If you guess the word before you run out of letters, you win.
6.  If you run out of letter choices before you guess the word, you will lose.
7.  Once the game is over, you will be allowed to choose to play again or not.
